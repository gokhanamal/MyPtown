# My-Ptown

"My Ptown" is my own iOS project that I currently work on. My Ptown app is basically a city guide for the people who visit Provincetown, Massachusetts, USA. In the app, people can see the point of interests in town as well as the events and many useful information. I aim to publish it on App Store soon.

Used technologies:
Sketch, Swift, MVVM, RESTful API, CocoaPods
